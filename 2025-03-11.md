# Template System Improvements - March 11, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### Fixed TypeScript Module Resolution Error

We resolved an issue where TypeScript was unable to find modules in the generated export files:

```
Cannot find module './dist/factory/index' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

#### Root Cause
- The TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) were using incorrect import paths that didn't match the JavaScript files
- The module resolution strategy in `tsconfig.json` was set to "bundler" which had issues with the generated re-export files

#### Solution
1. Updated `moduleResolution` in `tsconfig.json` from "bundler" to "node" to better handle the imports in the generated files
2. Modified the `scripts/create-nested-exports.js` script to generate TypeScript declaration files with the correct import paths, including the `.js` extension

### Improved Build Process

Enhanced the build process to properly clean up generated files:

1. Updated the `clean` script in `package.json` to remove all generated files in the root folder:
   ```json
   "clean": "rm -rf dist factory sections blocks types hooks utils components lib"
   ```
2. This ensures a clean build environment each time, preventing issues with stale files

## Testing

- Verified that the TypeScript compiler no longer reports any errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Successfully rebuilt the project with `npm run build`
- Confirmed that the generated files are properly created and can be imported without errors

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more comprehensive tests to verify the template system works correctly
- Document the build process and module structure for future reference
- Explore potential optimizations for the build process and module resolution
