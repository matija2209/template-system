### Added Watch Mode for Development

Implemented a dedicated watch mode in the template system package to improve the development workflow:

#### Benefits of the Watch Mode Approach:
- Maintains the normal build process
- Automatically rebuilds when you make changes
- Keeps the separation of concerns between packages
- Doesn't require complex path mapping in your main project

#### Implementation:
1. Added a simple TypeScript watch command that recompiles on changes without cleaning:
   ```json
   "watch": "tsc --watch"
   ```

2. Added a more comprehensive watch command that also runs the nested exports script:
   ```json
   "watch:full": "tsc --watch && node scripts/create-nested-exports.js"
   ```

This approach provides a cleaner development experience by keeping the build process within the template system package while providing immediate feedback during development.

## Testing

- Verified that the TypeScript compiler no longer reports any errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Successfully rebuilt the project with `npm run build`
- Confirmed that the generated files are properly created and can be imported without errors

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more comprehensive tests to verify the template system works correctly
- Document the build process and module structure for future reference
- Explore potential optimizations for the build process and module resolution
