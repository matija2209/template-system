## Package Export Refactoring

Today we completed a significant refactoring of the package's export structure to improve encapsulation and provide a cleaner public API. The main goal was to limit what external consumers can access, exposing only the factory functions while keeping all internal components as implementation details.

### What We Accomplished

1. **Restricted Public API**
   - Limited exports to only factory functions and the `createSection` utility
   - Prevented direct access to internal components, UI elements, and hooks
   - Maintained the ability to use all components internally within the package

2. **Implemented TypeScript Module Privacy**
   - Added `@internal` JSDoc tags to all internal modules
   - Configured `stripInternal: true` in tsconfig.json to exclude internal modules from declaration files
   - Created barrel files (index.ts) in all directories to control exports

3. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Created consistent directory structure with index files
   - Clearly separated public API from internal implementation
   - Added documentation comments to clarify intent

### Technical Implementation

The key changes included:

1. **Main Index File**
   - Removed exports of all internal components and utilities
   - Only exported factory functions and the `createSection` function
   - Re-exported only the necessary types for the public API

2. **Internal Module Structure**
   - Created index.ts files in all subdirectories
   - Marked all internal modules with `@internal` JSDoc tags
   - Maintained internal references for development

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Added `stripInternal: true` to tsconfig.json
   - Ensured declaration files only include public API

### Benefits

This refactoring provides several important benefits:

1. **Cleaner API Surface**: Consumers only see the essential functions they need
2. **Better Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details are hidden
3. **Reduced Risk of Breaking Changes**: Internal refactoring won't affect consumers
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation between public and private code
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Simpler, more focused API documentation

### Example Usage

The package now supports this clean usage pattern:

```typescript
import { createSection, createServicesSection } from '@schnellsite/template-system';

// Using factory functions directly
const servicesSection = createServicesSection({ 
  templateId: 'basic', 
  services: [...] 
});

// Or using the generic section creator
const testimonialSection = createSection(
  'testimonials',
  'carousel',
  { testimonials: [...] }
);
```

### Next Steps

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Adding comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public API functions
2. Creating detailed API documentation
3. Adding more factory functions for additional section types
4. Implementing stricter type checking for factory function parameters
